## About me

After several tragically failed attempts to describe myself, I decided to impose some constraints to see if it works.
I limited myself to only using 5 statements to depict my personality (kinda corny but I just can't escape it):

- Constraints can be freeing and freedom can be constraining
- Generally, I find beauty in simplicity, dissonance and abstraction
- "Laugh your tears away"
- "[_Ska_](https://twitter.com/jkmttr/status/1233398874133454849) your tears away" (c)
- I like bullet points

To find out more about me, feel free to explore the rest of the website :)
