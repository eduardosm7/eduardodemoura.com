# Readings

## About reading

I never considered myself to be a book person, but lately, I'm feeling the need to connect with books a bit more. My main motivation for reading is to learn something, therefore, I'll rarely read fictional/story books (even though I read some when I was younger [e.g. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]). The books I'll be interested in reading will most likely reflect my [interests](./interests) and [goals](./goals).

Nowadays I'm currently reading books either as e-books or audiobooks. When I'm reading I also always read out loud, so I can also practice my English speaking skills (since I'm not a native English speaker), training my pronunciation and muscle memory. By doing that, I can already notice great improvements. I also find audiobooks super useful for me, since I can learn things while doing trivial activities, such as cleaning my home and working out, other than the fact that I'm mostly an [auditory learner](http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-styles.shtml).

If you have similar book interests, please reach out. I'd be glad to discuss them with someone.
